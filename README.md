### ProjecEcon

  This research project examines how socio-medical factors, particularly mental health disorders, alcohol abuse, and healthcare expenditure, are associated with suicide rates across countries. Using cross-sectional data and econometric analysis, we aim to identify significant patterns and contribute evidence-based insights to support more effective mental health initiatives and public health strategies. The study emphasizes the importance of addressing mental health issues as a critical component of suicide prevention efforts worldwide.
